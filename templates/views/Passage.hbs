      question: " During the bilateral meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who is in the country for a visit. Modi said incidents of vandalism of Hindu temples cause concern to Indians. “Matter of regret that reports have come regularly from Australia in the last few weeks about attacks on temples , it is natural that such news makes people in India worried.

Albanese said defence and security is an important pillar amid the increasingly uncertain global security environment. The pact is the outcome of the online summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on 4th June 2020.It is called the Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA).

Modi said they agreed to step up cooperation in the field of renewable energy, and identified clean hydrogen and solar energy as the two areas of cooperation with Australia. While Albanese said he looked forward to welcoming Modi to Australia for the Quad leaders’ summit in May this year, PM Modi said he was looking forward to welcoming his Australian counterpart for his second visit to India later this year — for the G20 summit in Delhi in September. \n Q 1.When and where G20 summit will held  ",
